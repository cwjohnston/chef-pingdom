Description
===========

This cookbook provides libraries, resources and providers to configure and manage service checks and contacts on Pingdom's external monitoring system.

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10+ is recommended as this cookbook has not been tested with earlier versions.

A valid username, password and API key for your Pingdom account is required.

Recipes
=======

This cookbook provides a default recipe which installs the required `httparty` gem (verison ~> 0.11.0).

Resources and Providers
=======================

This cookbook provides a single resource (`pingdom_check`) and corresponding provider for managing Pingdom service checks.

`pingdom_check` resources support the actions `add` and `delete`, `add` being the default. Each `pingdom_check` resource requires the following resource attributes:

* `host` - indicates the hostname (or IP address) which the service check will target
* `api_key` - a valid API key for your Pingdom account
* `username` - your Pingdom username
* `password` - your Pingdom password

`pingdom_check` resources may also specifiy values for the optional `type` and `check_params` attributes.

The `type` attribute will accept one of the following service check types. If no value is specified, the check type will default to `http`.

* http
* tcp
* udp
* ping
* dns
* smtp
* pop3
* imap

The optional `check_params` attribute is expected to be a hash containing key/value pairs which match the type-specific parameters defined by the [Pingdom API](http://www.pingdom.com/services/api-documentation-rest/#ResourceChecks). If no attributes are provided for `check_params`, the default values for type-specific defaults will be used.

Usage
=====

In order to utilize this cookbook, put the following at the top of the recipe where Pingdom resources are used:

    include_recipe 'pingdom'

The following resource would configure a HTTP service check for the host `foo.example.com`:

    pingdom_check 'foo http check' do
      host 'foo.example.com'
      api_key node[:pingdom][:api_key]
      username node[:pingdom][:username]
      password node[:pingdom][:password]
    end

The resulting HTTP service check would be created using all the Pingdom defaults for HTTP service checks.

The following resource would configure an HTTP service check for the host `bar.example.com` utilizing some of the parameters specific to the HTTP service check type:

    pingdom_check 'bar.example.com http status check' do
      host 'bar.example.com'
      api_key node[:pingdom][:api_key]
      username node[:pingdom][:username]
      password node[:pingdom][:password]
      check_params :url => "/status",
                   :shouldcontain => "Everything is OK!",
                   :sendnotificationwhendown => 2,
                   :sendtoemail => "true",
                   :sendtoiphone => "true"
    end

Caveats
=======

* Changes in `check_params` do not modify the configuration of existing service checks.
* One must look up contact IDs manually if setting `contactids` in `check_params`
* Checks do not have an Alert Policy assigned by default.  To use the "Simple Up/Down Alerts", set `:use_legacy_notifications => true` in `check_params`.

Future
======

* Add support for managing contacts
* Add `enable` and `disable` actions for service checks
* Refactor to account for changes in `check_params` values
* Convert `TrueClass` attribute values to `"true"` strings
* Validate class types for `check_params` attributes
